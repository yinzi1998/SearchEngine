Online social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, and Flickrhave become a popular way to share and disseminate content. Theirmassive popularity has led to viral marketing techniques that at-tempt to spread content, products, and ideas on these sites. How-ever, there is little data publicly available on viral propagation inthe real world and few studies have characterized how informationspreads over current online social networks.In this paper, we collect and analyze large-scale traces of infor-mation dissemination in the Flickr social network. Our analysis,based on crawls of the favorite markings of 2.5 million users on11 million photos, aims at answering three key questions: (a) howwidely does information propagate in the social network? (b) howquickly does information propagate? and (c) what is the role ofword-of-mouth exchanges between friends in the overall propaga-tion of information in the network? Contrary to viral marketingâ€œintuition,â€? we find that (a) even popular photos do not spreadwidely throughout the network, (b) even popular photos spreadslowly through the network, and (c) information exchanged be-tween friends is likely to account for over 50% of all favorite-markings, but with a significant delay at each hop.Categories and Subject DescriptorsH.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online InformationServicesâ€”Web-based services; J.4 [Computer Applications]: So-cial and Behavioral Sciencesâ€”SociologyGeneral TermsHuman factors, MeasurementKeywordsInformation dissemination, cascades, social networks, viral mar-keting, Flickr
