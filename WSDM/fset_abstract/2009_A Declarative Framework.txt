In this paper, we present a framework for online discov-ery of semantic links from relational data. Our frameworkis based on declarative specification of the linkage require-ments by the user, that allows matching data items in manyreal-world scenarios. These requirements are translated toqueries that can run over the relational data source, poten-tially using the semantic knowledge to enhance the accuracyof link discovery. Our framework lets data publishers to eas-ily find and publish high-quality links to other data sources,and therefore could significantly enhance the value of thedata in the next generation of web.Categories and Subject DescriptorsH.2.5 [Information Systems]: Heterogeneous Databases;H.2.4 [Information Systems]: Systems; H.2.3 [InformationSystems]: LanguagesGeneral TermsAlgorithms, Design, LanguagesKeywordsLink Discovery, Record Linkage, Linked Data, Semantic Web
