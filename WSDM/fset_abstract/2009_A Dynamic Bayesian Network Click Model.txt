As with any application of machine learning, web searchranking requires labeled data. The labels usually come inthe form of relevance assessments made by editors. Clicklogs can also provide an important source of implicit feed-back and can be used as a cheap proxy for editorial labels.The main difficulty however comes from the so called posi-tion bias â€? urls appearing in lower positions are less likelyto be clicked even if they are relevant. In this paper, wepropose a Dynamic Bayesian Network which aims at pro-viding us with unbiased estimation of the relevance fromthe click logs. Experiments show that the proposed clickmodel outperforms other existing click models in predictingboth click-through rate and relevance.Categories and Subject DescriptorsH.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]; H.3.5 [OnlineInformation Services]; I.2.6 [ARTIFICIAL INTELLI-GENCE]: Learning; I.6.m [SIMULATION AND MOD-ELING]: MiscellaneousGeneral TermsAlgorithms, Design, ExperimentationKeywordsClick-through rate, Click modeling, Web search, Ranking,Dynamic Bayesian network
