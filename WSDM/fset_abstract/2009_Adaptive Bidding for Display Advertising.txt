Motivated by the emergence of auction-based marketplacesfor display ads such as the Right Media Exchange, we studythe design of a bidding agent that implements a display ad-vertising campaign by bidding in such a marketplace. Thebidding agent must acquire a given number of impressionswith a given target spend, when the highest external bid inthe marketplace is drawn from an unknown distribution P.The quantity and spend constraints arise from the fact thatdisplay ads are usually sold on a CPM basis. We considerboth the full information setting, where the winning pricein each auction is announced publicly, and the partially ob-servable setting where only the winner obtains informationabout the distribution; these differ in the penalty incurredby the agent while attempting to learn the distribution. Weprovide algorithms for both settings, and prove performanceguarantees using bounds on uniform closeness from statis-tics, and techniques from online learning. We experimen-tally evaluate these algorithms: both algorithms performvery well with respect to both target quantity and spend;further, our algorithm for the partially observable case per-forms nearly as well as that for the fully observable settingdespite the higher penalty incurred during learning.Categories and Subject DescriptorsF.2.0 [Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complex-ity]: General; J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Eco-nomics; I.2.6 [Artificial Intelligence]: LearningGeneral TermsAlgorithms, Economics, TheoryKeywordsDisplay advertising, guaranteed delivery, adaptive bidding,guess-then-double algorithms, concentration boundsCopyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Com-mittee (IW3C2).
