Automated text categorization is an important techniquefor many web applications, such as document indexing, doc-ument filtering, and cataloging web resources. Many dif-ferent approaches have been proposed for the automatedtext categorization problem. Among them, centroid-basedapproaches have the advantages of short training time andtesting time due to its computational efficiency. As a result,centroid-based classifiers have been widely used in many webapplications. However, the accuracy of centroid-based clas-sifiers is inferior to SVM, mainly because centroids foundduring construction are far from perfect locations.We design a fast Class-Feature-Centroid (CFC) classifierfor multi-class, single-label text categorization. In CFC,a centroid is built from two important class distributions:inter-class term index and inner-class term index. CFCproposes a novel combination of these indices and employsa denormalized cosine measure to calculate the similarityscore between a text vector and a centroid. Experiments onthe Reuters-21578 corpus and 20-newsgroup email collectionshow that CFC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-artSVM classifiers on both micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores. Par-ticularly, CFC is more effective and robust than SVM whendata is sparse.Categories and Subject DescriptorsI.5.2 [Pattern Recognition]: Design Methodology—Clas-sifier design and evaluation; Feature evaluation and selec-tion; I.5.4 [Pattern Recognition]: Applications—Text pro-cessingGeneral TermsAlgorithms, Experimentation, PerformanceKeywordscentroid, text classification, inter-class, inner-class, denor-malized cosine measure
